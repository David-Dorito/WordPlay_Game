WordPlay is a real-time multiplayer game built in C# with WPF for the frontend and has a backend server also made with C# and the SignalR library.
I developed this project to learn how to synchronize data between clients, handle live communication between players, and manage both client and server sides of an app.

### Tech Stack
- Languages: C#, XAML
- Frontend: C#, XAML, WPF framework
- Backend: C#, SignalR library
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022, NeoVim

### Features:
- Realtime communication between server and clients using the SignalR library
- Lobby creation for hosting or joining game sessions
- Temporary player handling without accounts or profiles
- Data sync between connected clients

### Learning Outcomes
- Gained experience in designing clientâ€“server applications
- Improved understanding of async programming and event handling
- Strengthened general debugging and testing skills

I have tested this project locally and it worked with multiple clients without issues.
